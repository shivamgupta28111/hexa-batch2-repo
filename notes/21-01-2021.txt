JUnit -> unit testing framework

Unit Testing:
is a process to verify that a piece of code is working.
done by writing a function/ method

Why?
1. helps to identify defects
2. forces the developer to read his code
3. helps develop reliable, bug - free code

Parts
1. Test Fixture
2. Test Suite -> all the test methods are stored inside this class 
3. Test Cases -> test methods
4. Annotations
5. Assertions

Annotations
1. @Test -> the method is a test case
Ex:
   @Test
   public void testShowAllCars() {
   
   }

2. @Before -> specifies that the method should be executed before every test
3. @After -> specifies that the method has to be executed after every test
4. @BeforeClass -> executed only once before the test suite is run
5. @AfterClass -> executed only once after the test suite is run

Assertions -> Assert class
1. assertEquals(actual, expected)
2. assertNotEquals(actual, expected)
3. assertNull(object)
4. assertNotNull(object)
5. assertTrue(condition)
6. assertFalse(condition)

Running test cases in Maven
1. mvn test -> runs all the test cases across the project

2. mvn -Dtest=<name of test class> test -> runs the test cases in a particular class
  ex: 
  mvn -Dtest=CarsTest test

3. mvn -Dtest=<test class name>#<test method name> test -> runs a single testcase only
  ex:
  mvn -Dtest=CarsTest#testAddCar test
========================================================================================

JMockit/Mockito -> Mocking framework

Annotations:
@Mocked
@Mock

Anonymous Classes
Expectations -> used to set the expectations
MockUp -> Mock a model /factory class

Tiered architecture
1. two tier 
2. multi tier
	Layer a: Backend/ Persistence layer -> Database
	Layer b: Business Layer / Business Logic -> Java/C#/Python
	Layer c: Presentation Layer/Frontend -> UI Layer -> Angular, React, HTML, CSS, JS
